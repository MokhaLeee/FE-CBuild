The Demon King killed my family[NL]
and took over my country![A][NL]
To get to him I need[NL]
to go through you![A][X]

[Right]
Alright. Now that those mooks are dealt[NL]
with, let us kill the Demon King.[A][NL]
[Left]
No, Void. There's still[NL]
29 chapters of mooks to go.[A][NL]
[Right]
WHAT?! I want to kill[NL]
the Demon King now.[A]
[Left]
Unfortunately, that is presently[NL]
not possible. When the Demon King[A][NL]
killed your father, he took the only[NL]
weapon able to kill him, the Super[A][NL]
Blitz. I hazard a guess it'll take[NL]
roughly a full fan hack to re-obtain[A][NL]
it so we can actually kill the Demon King.[A][NL]
[Right]
Leeroy, sometimes I hate you.[A]
[Left]
It's part of the job, Void.[A][X]
